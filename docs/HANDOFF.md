# Handoff

Japanese version: [HANDOFF_jp.md](HANDOFF_jp.md)

Read this first when resuming. Decisions and rationale: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## State (2026-10-10, end of cloud design session 2)

- Design for all three layers written in DESIGN.md. Nothing built yet.
- Reference: tch-rs `4227b89b72059b0651ff83a38637693574e0a2d6`,
  libtorch 2.13.0.
- Decided: fork tch-rs libtch (keep C names, harden `PROTECT`, guard
  `extern "C"`), shared `libtch.so`, `TTensor` = record wrapping a refcounted
  interface, exceptions via `ETorchError`/`ETorchNativeError` after every
  call, nil-handle check before every non-optional tensor argument,
  snake_case generated ops (`&`-escaped where reserved) + CamelCase
  hand-written API, `out` parameters for multi-output ops, generated default
  parameters for trailing simple arguments, `TOptIntList` for
  `IntListOption`, Pascal emitter fed by a manifest from a forked gen.ml.
- License: MIT OR Apache-2.0, same as tch-rs (`LICENSE-MIT`,
  `LICENSE-APACHE` at the repo root). Vendored tch-rs files keep tch-rs's own
  license copies next to them.
- OCaml: `gen/gen.ml` is vendored as source (part of the fork). The OCaml
  compiler and opam packages (`yaml`, `base`, `stdio`, `dune`) are installed
  on the local machine to run it; they are a maintainer tool, needed only
  when regenerating for a new libtorch, never to build tch-fpc.
- Session 2 reviewed section 4 against tch-rs's sources and added 4.6 (nn /
  VarStore / optimizers / JIT as classes + `TVarPath` record, single
  `Forward(X, Train = False)`) and 4.7 (grad mode). Unverified FPC 3.2.2
  behaviour is marked **(H1)**–**(H11)** in DESIGN.md and listed below.

## Next steps (local implementation)

1. **Toolchain check.** FPC 3.2.2, g++, CMake, libtorch 2.13.0 CPU
   (cxx11 ABI) unpacked into `libtorch/` (already git-ignored).
2. **Vendor libtch.** Copy from tch-rs at the commit above into
   `csrc/libtch/` and `gen/`; add LICENSE-MIT / LICENSE-APACHE. Commit the
   pristine copy first (message names the source files), then a second
   commit with our patch: remove stream/python/image code, add `tchf_free`,
   add `catch (...)` to `PROTECT`, wrap `extern "C"` in
   `torch_api_generated.h` with `#ifdef __cplusplus`. Build `libtch.so` with
   CMake. The YAML (`third_party/pytorch/Declarations-v2.13.0.yaml`) is in
   the tch-rs repo at that commit but may be missing from a shallow/partial
   clone; fetch it only when regenerating.
3. **Smoke test in C** (tiny C program, not Python): create a tensor,
   `atg_add`, print, trigger an error and read `get_and_reset_last_err`.
   Needs the `extern "C"` guard from step 2 to include the generated header.
4. **ABI verification in Pascal** — measure, do not assume:
   - `bool` returns (e.g. `at_autocast_is_enabled`) read correctly as
     `Boolean`.
   - `c10::ScalarType` numeric values match `TKind`, including the Float8
     kinds 23–26 (print `at_scalar_type` for tensors of each kind).
   - `uint8_t x_null` option flags as `Byte`, `int8_t` as `ShortInt`.
   - Linking: `external 'tch'` + rpath so the program finds `libtch.so` and
     libtorch at run time.
   - Passing a `nullptr` tensor to a non-optional argument really is a
     segfault (confirms the need for the nil-handle check).
5. **FPU mask tests.**
   - Without `SetExceptionMask`, does `1.0 / 0` on a CPU tensor crash an FPC
     program? Confirm the fix in `Tch` initialization.
   - **(H4)** After `SetExceptionMask` in the main thread, does a `TThread`
     started afterwards see the mask, or the FPC defaults? Decides whether
     `TchMaskFpuExceptions` must be called in every thread.
   - **(H5)** Raise and catch an `EZeroDivide` in Pascal code, then run a
     tensor op that produces NaN. Does the mask survive the RTL's SIGFPE
     handling?
6. **Ownership tests.** Loop 10^6 times over `(A + B) * C` and check RSS is
   flat; check `B := A` then `A := Default(TTensor)` keeps B alive.
   - **(H1)** Instrument `TTensorHandle.Destroy` and determine when the
     temporaries of `(A + B) * C` are released: end of statement, end of
     loop iteration, or end of routine.
   - **(H6)** `TTensor.cat([A, B], 0)` with an open-array constructor of
     `TTensor`: no leak, no double free.
   - **(H8)** `out` parameter semantics: `T.max_dim(1, False, T, I)` raises
     `ETorchError` (receiver finalised on entry) instead of crashing, and
     `V` passed as `out` with a previous value releases the old handle.
7. **Compiler acceptance tests** (tiny programs before the generator exists):
   - **(H2)** `FromArray([1.0, 2.0])` with overloads on `array of Single`
     and `array of Double` compiles unambiguously; same for `[1, 2]` with
     `Int32`/`Int64`. If not, use `FromSingles`/`FromDoubles`/...
   - **(H3)** Operator overloads `+(TTensor, Double)` and `+(TTensor, Int64)`
     coexist and `T + 1`, `T + 1.5`, `2 * T` all resolve; `**` can be
     overloaded for records; unary `-` too.
   - **(H7)** Record methods named `&div`, `&var`, `&to`, `&set`, `&repeat`,
     and modifiers `absolute`, `alias`, `index` (with and without `&`)
     compile and can be called as `t.&div(u)`.
   - **(H9)** `Forward(const X: TTensor; Train: Boolean = False)` as a
     virtual abstract method with the default repeated in overrides; calling
     `Model.Forward(X)` through the base and derived type.
   - **(H10)** `TIValue = record ... Items: array of TIValue; end;` compiles.
   - **(H11)** An `IInterface` local assigned from `NoGradGuard` is released
     at routine exit (and not earlier).
   - A record with ~2,650 methods pulled in via `{$I}` inside the record
     declaration compiles in reasonable time; `{$modeswitch advancedrecords}`
     properties on records if the `T[i]` sugar is wanted.
8. **Generator.** Add `ops.tsv` output to gen.ml (exported name, kind,
   receiver, result shape, args with defaults, return names); write
   `gen/tchgen.pas`; generate `TchSysGenerated.pas` and the `.inc` files;
   compile everything. Include the case-insensitive collision check against
   hand-written names (`data`, `grad`, `detach`, `to_device`, `clone`, ...).

## Open questions

- **Multi-output ops**: `out` parameters (decided) — revisit whether a few
  hand-written result records (`max_dim`, `sort`, `topk`, `lstm`) are worth
  adding after writing real code. Also whether `var` instead of `out` is
  preferable if (H8) shows the aliasing hazard bites in practice.
- **Default arguments.** The generator emits defaults for trailing
  Bool/Int64/Double/String runs. How many ops benefit, and which
  hand-written convenience overloads (e.g. `TTensor.zeros([2, 3])` with
  `kFloat`/CPU) are worth adding in the first milestone.
- **Equality and containers.** `=` is deliberately not overloaded for
  `TTensor`, which rules out FGL (`TFPGList<TTensor>`). Confirm
  `Generics.Collections.TList<TTensor>` and plain `TTensorArray` cover the
  needs of `TchNN`; otherwise reconsider an identity `=`.
- **Train flag.** `Forward(X, Train)` parameter (decided) vs a PyTorch-style
  `Training` property propagated through children. Revisit once
  `TSequential` and a custom-model example exist.
- **`TIValue` representation.** Tagged record (decided, pending H10) vs an
  fpjson-style class hierarchy.
- **VarStore thread safety.** Documented as not thread-safe; add a
  `TCriticalSection` if a data-loader thread ever needs it.
- **Streams / images.** If needed later: replace tch-rs's Rust-implemented
  stream symbols with a struct of C function pointers passed in by Pascal
  (wrapping `TStream`). Images can be done in Pascal (FPImage) instead of stb.
- **Windows / macOS.** Not designed yet beyond `cdecl` and `tchf_free`.
  Windows additionally needs symbol export from `tch.dll`
  (`--export-all-symbols` or a `.def` file).
- **Release packaging.** Generated files (`ops.tsv`, `torch_api_generated.*`,
  `TchSysGenerated.pas`, `.inc`) are committed, so every tag's source archive
  builds without OCaml. Open: whether releases also attach prebuilt
  `libtch.so`/`tch.dll` per libtorch version and platform, or users always
  build it with CMake. libtorch itself is never bundled.
- **Going public.** The license is decided (below); the repo stays private
  until the user decides to publish it.
